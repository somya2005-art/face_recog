Face_Recog

Description
Face_Recog is a facial recognition project that enables users to detect and recognize faces in images and video streams using machine learning techniques. The system is designed to be user-friendly and customizable, supporting face detection that helps the users to give their feedback, suggestions and compaints which will be sent to the admin. The admin then gets the access to all of the aove and improve their university. The project is currently under active development and updates are ongoing—features, performance, and documentation may change frequently as improvements are made. Admin access will be added along with proper backend. Only complaint.html, suggest.html and feedback.html are prepared.
